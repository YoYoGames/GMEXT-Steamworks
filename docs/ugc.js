// FUNCTIONS

/**
 * @func steam_is_screenshot_requested
 * @desc This function will poll the Steam API to see if the key for taking a screenshot of the game has been pressed. The function will only return `true` for one step (game tick) when the key is pressed, and will return `false` at all other times.
 * Please note that if the screenshot key is pressed, this function will only return `true` once for each step that it is pressed, and return `false` for any subsequent calls *within the same step* . For example, if a screenshot is requested in the current frame and you call this function in the Step event to find that out, you will get `true`; however, if you call it again in Draw GUI to check whether a screenshot was requested, you will get `false` as the function had already been "used up" in the ${event.step}. To use the function's return value multiple times within the same frame, it is recommended to store it in a variable and read that instead of calling the function again.
 * 
 * [[NOTE: This function does not take a screenshot for you. This only signals that the key has been pressed and you must use the GameMaker functions ${function.screen_save} or ${function.screen_save_part} to save a local copy of the file to be uploaded.]]
 * 
 * @returns {boolean}
 * 
 * @example
 * ```gml
 * if steam_is_screenshot_requested()
 * {
 *     var _file = "Catch_The_Haggis_" + string(global.scrn_num) + ".png");
 *     screen_save(_file);
 *     steam_send_screenshot(_file, window_get_width(), window_get_height());
 *     global.scrn_num += 1;
 * }
 * ```
 * The above code will poll the Steam API for a screenshot request. If there is one, a unique name for the image file will be generated, a screenshot will be taken, and the file will be sent to the Steam Community page for the user.
 * @func_end
 */

/**
 * @func steam_send_screenshot
 * @desc With this function you can upload a screenshot to the Steam Community profile page of the currently logged in user. The filename you supply is the name of the local file that was created when you took the screenshot using the GameMaker functions ${function.screen_save} or ${function.screen_save_part}. The width and height define the image size, and the function will return a value of 0 if it fails for whatever reason and a value greater than 0 if it succeeds.
 * 
 * @param {string} filename The name of the image file to upload.
 * @param {real} width The width of the image.
 * @param {real} height The height of the image.
 * 
 * @returns {real}
 * 
 * @example
 * ```gml
 * if steam_is_screenshot_requested()
 * {
 *     var _file = "Catch_The_Haggis_" + string(global.scrn_num) + ".png");
 *     screen_save(_file);
 *     steam_send_screenshot(_file, window_get_width(), window_get_height());
 *     global.scrn_num += 1;
 * }
 * ```
 * The above code will poll the Steam API for a screenshot request. If there is one, a unique name for the image file will be generated, a screenshot will be taken, and the file will be sent to the Steam Community page for the user.

/**
 * @func steam_ugc_create_item
 * @desc This function is used to prepare the Workshop API and generate a published file ID for the item to be added. The function *must* be called before doing anything else with the item to be uploaded, as you will be required to use the unique published ID value that it returns in the Steam Async Event for updating.
 * This is an asynchronous function that will return an asynchronous id and trigger the ${event.steam} when the task is finished.
 * 
 * @param {real} consumer_app_id The unique App ID for your game on Steam.
 * @param {constant.UGCFileType} file_type One of the available file type constants (see ${constant.UGCFileType} constants).
 * 
 * @returns {real}
 * 
 * @event steam
 * @member {real} id The asynchronous request ID
 * @member {string} event_type The string value `"ugc_create_item"`
 * @member {real} result This will either be the GML constant `ugc_result_success` or some other real number (see the [Steam docs](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#EResult), for more details)
 * @member {boolean} legal_agreement_required Will be `true` or `false` (see the [Steam docs](https://partner.steamgames.com/documentation/ugc#Legal) for more details)
 * @member {int64} published_file_id This key holds the unique published ID for the item (you may need to cast it using the ${type.int64} function).
 * @event_end
 *
 * @example
 * In this example we first call the function and store the async ID value in a variable:
 * 
 * ```gml
 * var _app_id = steam_get_app_id();
 * new_item = steam_ugc_create_item(_app_id, ugc_filetype_community);
 * ```
 * This would then send off a request to the Steam API to create the new Workshop item, generating an async event which we would deal with as follows:
 * 
 * ```gml
 * var _event_id = async_load[? "id"];
 * if _event_id == new_item
 * {
 *     var _type = async_load[? "event_type"];
 *     if _type == "ugc_create_item"
 *     {
 *         global.Publish_ID = async_load[? "published_file_id"];
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * The above code checks the event type and if it is "ugc_create_item" then it retrieves the published file ID and stores it in a global variable for future reference.
 * @func_end
 */

/**
 * @func steam_ugc_delete_item
 * @desc This function attempts to delete a previously published UGC item.
 * This is an asynchronous function that will return an asynchronous ID and trigger the ${event.steam} when the task is finished.
 * 
 * @param {real} ugc_query_handle The query handle to use.
 * 
 * @returns {real}
 * 
 * @event steam
 * @member {real} id The asynchronous request ID
 * @member {string} event_type The string value `"ugc_item_delete"`
 * @member {real} result This will either be the GML constant `ugc_result_success` or some other real number (see the [Steam docs](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#EResult), for more details)
 * @event_end
 * 
 * @example
 * ```gml
 * steam_ugc_delete_item(ugc_query_handle);
 * ```
 * The above code creates a deletion request for `ugc_query_handle`.
 * @func_end
 */

/**
 * @func steam_ugc_start_item_update
 * @desc This function must be called before adding or updating information on a UGC item. You need to supply the unique App ID for your game on Steam, along with the unique published file ID that was returned for the item when you created it using the function ${function.steam_ugc_create_item}. The function will return a unique update handle for the item, which you can then use in the UGC item functions to update (or add) information for uploading.
 * 
 * @param {real} consumer_app_id The unique App ID for your game on Steam.
 * @param {int64} published_file_id The unique published file ID value for the item.
 * 
 * @returns {real}

 * If the item exists then the function will return `true` and populate the map, otherwise it will return `false` and the map will remain empty.
 * 
 * |Key|Type|Description|
 * |----|----|----|
 * |needs_update|${type.boolean}|Whether the item needs an update or not|
 * |is_downloading|${type.boolean}|Whether the item is currently downloading or not|
 * |bytes_downloaded|${type.real}|The number of bytes that has been downloaded|
 * |bytes_total|${type.real}|The total size (number of bytes) required for the item on disk|
 * 
 * @param {int64} published_file_id The unique file ID for the UGC to be checked.
 * @param {type.ds_map} info_map A (previously created) DS map index.
 * 
 * @returns {boolean}
 * 
 * @example
 * ```gml
 * var _info_map = ds_map_create();
 * var _info = steam_ugc_get_item_update_info(global.fileID, _info_map);

/**
 * @func steam_ugc_download
 * @desc With this function you can download a preview image for any given UGC item. The `ugc_handle` is the unique identifying value for the image (which you can get using the function ${function.steam_ugc_send_query}), and the destination filename is the name (and local path within the Steam sandbox) that you wish to give the image file when the download is complete.
 * This is an asynchronous function that will return an asynchronous ID and trigger the ${event.steam} when the task is finished.
 * 
 * @param {int64} ugc_handle The unique handle for the preview to be downloaded.
 * @param {string} dest_filename The filename to save the preview with.
 * 
 * @returns {real}
 * 
 * @event steam
 * @member {real} id The asynchronous request ID
 * @member {string} event_type The string value `"ugc_create_item"`
 * @member {real} result This will either be the GML constant `ugc_result_success` or some other real number (see the [Steam docs](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api) under **EResult** for more details)
 * @member {string} original_filename This key holds the original name of the image file *on the server* (a string)
 * @member {string} dest_filename This key holds the image file name you passed in (a string)
 * @member {real} ugc_handle The unique identifying value for the image
 * @event_end
 * 
 * @example
 * In this example we first call the function and store the async ID value in a variable:
 * 
 * ```gml
 * steam_get = steam_ugc_download(steam_handle, "\UGC\Preview_file.png");
 * ```
 * This would then send off a file request to the Steam API, generating an async event which we would deal with as follows:
 * 
 * ```gml
 * var _event_id = async_load[? "id"];
 * if _event_id == steam_get
 * {
 *     var _type = async_load[? "event_type"];
 *     if _type == "ugc_download"
 *     {
 *         sprite_delete(preview_sprite);
 *         preview_sprite = sprite_add(async_load[? "dest_filename"], 0, false, false, 0, 0);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * The above code checks the event type and then creates a sprite from the downloaded image.

/**
 * @module ugc
 * @title UGC
 * @desc This section is for those users that have been given access to the Steam API for publishing your game to that platform and that want to use the possibilities that the Steam Workshop and Community gives you for adding and generating user content in your projects. The simplest form of user-generated content is the ability for the user to take and share screenshots, which is facilitated using the following two functions:
 * 
 * * ${function.steam_is_screenshot_requested}
 * * ${function.steam_send_screenshot}
 * 
 * Before using any of the built-in functions for the Steam UGC (**U**ser **G**enerated **C**ontent) API you need to have set up your game correctly from the Steam dashboard and you should have read through the required documentation found here:
 * 
 * * [Sharing User-Generated Content](https://partner.steamgames.com/documentation/ugc#Tech)
 * 
 * [[NOTE: You need to have your game accepted for the Steam online store and have access to the developer areas of the Steam API documentation.]]
 * 
 * All subscribed UGC items will be downloaded by the Steam client automatically, and you should have code in the ${event.steam} to catch this and store the ID of the UGC that has been downloaded for use in the other UGC functions.
 * 
 * [[WARNING: Steam UGC IDs can be huge numbers. This means that sometimes you may need to store these as a string rather than try and store them as a real value, especially if working with buffers or trying to write the value to a text file (since this will convert it to a simplified standard format like "6.6624e+003" which will cause issues being read back).]]
 * 
 * The normal workflow for getting UGC into your game would be as follows:
 * 
 * 1. The user would subscribe to an item (either from your game using ${function.steam_ugc_subscribe_item} or from the client/browser). If done from the game you are able to "listen" to the callback from the Steam Async Event.
 * 2. When you get a successful subscription callback this means that your game is now downloading the UGC. You would then check if the item is installed (i.e.: download completed) with ${function.steam_ugc_get_item_install_info}.
 * 3. If the item is not completely installed, you can use ${function.steam_ugc_get_item_update_info} to track the download progress.
 * 
 * The following sections explain all the functions required to get UGC functioning in GameMaker:
 * 
 * @section_func Creating And Editing Content
 * @desc The following functions are essentially "wrapper" functions for those supplied in the Steam API for creating and uploading content to their servers. As such, we recommend that you read over the linked Steam documentation before using them to gain a greater understanding of how they work: [Creating And Uploading Content](https://partner.steamgames.com/documentation/ugc#CreateUploadContent).

 * @desc Once your user content has been created and the workshop has it available for download, people can subscribe to it through the Steam App or through the Web portal. However GameMaker also includes the following functions to use the Steam API for creating and canceling subscriptions as well as for getting information about what the user is subscribed to currently:
