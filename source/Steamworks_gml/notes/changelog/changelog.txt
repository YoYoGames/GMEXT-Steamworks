1.4.2
- macOS script changes, please see below:
VM:
- call `codesign` on the dylibs and the .app to resign everything with the same team id.
  this will only work for macOS builds as of now.
YYC:
- patch the Xcode project to require necessary entitlements[1].
- forcefully disable 'App Sandbox', IAPs and Game Center, since neither of these are functional
  in Steamworks builds anyway.
  this will work for both Windows remote builds and local macOS builds.

The notarization of the app is not performed automatically by Steamworks specifically,
but rather by a separate extension called "Notarizer",
this extension is designed for all non-App-Store game builds like itch/GameJolt and Steamworks too.
